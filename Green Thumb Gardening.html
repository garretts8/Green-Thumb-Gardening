              Did you know that to save time during the winter season you could
              start your vegetable garden indoors? Have you ever wondered what
              it would take to grow healthy vegetables from the comfort of your
              home? Do you desire to have fresh greens, no matter the season,
              and at little to no cost to you? Keep reading to learn more about
              starting an indoor garden.

              Decide When to Plant
            </h2>
            <p class="home-para2">
              First you need to start by deciding when you want to plant. If you
              intend on just growing herbs indoors or you are planning on
              growing and maintaining an indoor garden you can begin right away.
              If your intention is to grow an indoor garden, and to later
              transfer your indoor garden outdoors, then you might want to start
              your garden a little closer to spring. You will also want to pay
              close attention to the weather. Do not plant outside until you are
              sure that daytime and nighttime temperatures will remain above 45
              degrees Fahrenheit for a growing season, otherwise the startling
              might die or their growth may be stunted.

            </h2>
            <p class="home-para3">
              You will need to have a sunny window (preferably a south facing
              window). If a sunny window is not available you also have the
              option of using grow lights. AeroGarden and Hydroponics have
              growing systems that are great for starting and maintaining an
              indoor garden, and they can be used in any area of the house, so
              long as the temperature can be maintained at 65 degrees or higher
              at night, and 70 – 80 degrees during the day.

              Microgreen gardens
            </h3>
            <p class="sub-para1">
              If you are planting a microgreen garden then you could be growing
              and harvesting vegetables in as little as 7 to 10 days. Turnips,
              chives, nasturtiums, sunflowers, wheatgrass, peas, salad mix,
              alliums and more can be planted in a microgreen garden. You will
              need a lot of seeds to do a microgreen garden. Bulk seeds can be
              purchased at places like Leaf Market or Everwilde Farms. Dependent
              on the type of seeds that you wish to plant, you might need to
              prepare the seeds by soaking them for 2 to 3 days before planting
              them. After preparing the seed, begin by adding 2 cups of water to
              a 10 X 20 starter tray. Add soil until it is just below the rim,
              and smooth out the surface. Sprinkle ¼ cup of seed evenly over the
              top of the soil. Fill a spray bottle with water and spray a layer
              of mist over the seed mixture. Cover your tray using another 10 X
              20 tray, and check in 2 to 3 days to see if your seeds have
              germinated. When the seeds have begun to grow uncover the
              seedlings and turn on your growing lights. Fluorescent and LED
              growing lights work best, and should be used 12 to 16 hours a day
              only. Any longer than that and you could burn your plants. When
              your plants have grown their first pair of true leaves(not your
              seed leaves) then is the time for your garden to be harvested.
              Grasses can be cut and allowed to regrow up to three times before
              you would have to begin a new batch.

              Growing Other Vegetables of a Longer Duration
            </h3>
            <p class="sub-para2">
              You can also plant vegetables like carrots, lettuce, peas,
              potatoes, sweet potatoes, radishes, among other things. The sky is
              the limit if you have enough space and proper lighting. You can
              grow your indoor garden in a large container with holes in the
              bottom or you can use peat pellets in a mini greenhouse. For those
              using peat pellets, follow the instructions given in the
              greenhouse packet. If you are planting in a larger container then
              you’ll need to place one to two inches of organic potting soil
              into your container. Scatter seeds in rows over the surface of the
              soil. You'll then want to cover your seeds with a thin layer of
              soil. Place the container with your seeds into a drip tray, and
              then gently water your seeds. Place saran wrap over the top of the
              tray and poke a few holes in it. Allow for your seeds to grow.
              Once leaves begin to appear, remove the saran wrap and place the
              tray under your grow light. Follow direction on your seed packet
              to determine how often your particular vegetable would need to be
              watered and how much light is required. You might find that you
              want certain vegetables directly under the light, while others
              would prefer to be placed a little further away from the light. As
              your plants grow, pay close attention to their roots. If the
              container is too small the plant can become root bound, which can
              stunt its growth and affect how quickly it will start producing.
              When space for the roots become limited transplant the plant in a
              larger container.

              Be Consistent
            </h2>
            <p class="home-para5">
              Create a habit of watering your plant at the same time.
              Consistency helps the plants to stay out of survival mode, and
              will allow your plant to grow and produce. Enjoy watching your
              garden grow, and relish in the blessing of having fresh, healthy,
              delicious vegetables right at your fingertips.
