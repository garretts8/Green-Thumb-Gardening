      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of the website is to share gardening tips on how to start an
        indoor vegetable garden. The website provides planting techniques
        specific to certain plants, and lets you know how quickly you can
        harvest certain vegetables. Did you know that to save time and money you
        could start your garden indoors? Want to get a jump on the season and
        save weeks of growing time? Do you desire to have fresh greens, no
        matter the season, and at little to no cost to you? Keep reading to
        discover how easy it is to start your garden today!
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My audience would be people who simply desire to learn how to garden
        indoors. It would attract people who live in urban communities with
        limited to no outdoor space and who desire to learn how to grow and
        maintain an indoor garden. The website will also attract those who live
        in colder climates with shorter growing seasons who wish to shave off a
        few weeks off of their growing season. And it will provide an
        opportunity to grow a variety of vegetables that are not typically found
        as starter plants in stores.

        Indoor Gardening
      </h1>
      <p>
        Did you know that to save time during the winter season you could start
        your vegetable garden indoors? Have you ever wondered what it would take
        to grow healthy vegetables from the comfort of your home? Read on to
        learn more about starting an indoor garden.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Decide When to Plant
      </h2>
      <p>
        First you need to start by deciding what you want to plant. If you
        intend on just growing herbs indoors or you are planning on growing and
        maintaining an indoor garden you can begin right away. If you intention
        is to grow an indoor garden, and to later transfer your indoor garden
        outdoors, then you might want to start your garden a little closer to
        spring. You will also want to pay close attention to the weather. Do not
        plant outside until you are sure that daytime and nighttime temperatures
        will remain above 45 degrees Fahrenheit for a growing season, otherwise
        the startling will die or its growth may be stunted.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Choose a good location
      </h2>
      <p>
        You would need to have a sunny window (preferably a south facing
        window). If a sunny windo is not available you also have the option of
        using grow lights. AeroGarden and Hydroponics have growing systems that
        are great for starting and maintaining an indoor garden, and they can be
        used in any area of the house, so long as the temperature can be
        maintained at 65 degrees or higher at night, and 70 – 80 degrees during
        the day.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Decide What to Plant
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Microgreen gardens
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you are planting a microgreen garden then you could be growing and
        harvesting vegetables in as little as 7 to 10 days. Turnips, chives,
        nasturtiums, sunflowers, wheatgrass, peas, salad mix, chives, alliums
        and more can be planted in a microgreen garden. You will need a lot of
        seeds to do a microgreen garden. Bulk seeds can be purchased at places
        like Leaf Market or Everwilde Farms. Dependent on the type of seed that
        you want to plant, you might need to soak your seed for 2 to 3 days
        before planting them. Begin by adding 2 cups of water to your 10 X 20
        starter tray. Add soil until it is just below the rim, and smooth out
        the surface. Sprinkle ¼ cup of seed evenly over the top of the soil.
        Fill a spray bottle with water and spray a layer of mist over the seed
        mixture. Cover your tray using another 10 X 20 tray, and check in 2 to
        three days to if your seeds have germinated. When the seeds have begun
        to grow uncover the seedlings and turn on your growing lights.
        Fluorescent and LED growing lights work best, and should be used 12 to
        16 hours a day only. Any longer than that and you could burn your
        plants. When your plants have grown their first pair of true leaves (not
        your seed leaves) then it is time for your garden to be harvested.
        Grasses can be cut and allowed to regrow up to three times before you
        would have to begin a new batch.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Growing Other Vegetables of a Longer Duration
      </h3>
      <p>
        You can also plant vegetables like carrots, lettuce, peas, potatoes,
        sweet potatoes, radishes, among other things. The sky is the limit if
        you have enough space and proper lighting. You can grow your indoor
        garden in a large container with holes in the bottom for or you can use
        peat pellets in a mini green house. For those using peat pellets, follow
        the instructions given in the greenhouse packet. If you are planting in
        a larger container then you’ll need to place one to two inches of
        organic potting soil into your container. Scatter seeds in rows over the
        surface of the soil. You'll then want to cover your seeds with a thin
        layer of soil. Place the container with your seeds into a drip tray, and
        then gently water your seeds. Place saran wrap over the top of the tray
        and poke a few holes on the top. Allow for your seeds to grow. Once
        leaves begin to appear remove the saran wrap and place the tray under
        your grow light. Follow direction on your seed packet to determine how
        often your particular vegetable would need to be watered and how much
        light is required. You might find that you want certain vegetables
        directly under the light, while others would prefer to be placed a
        little further away. As your plants grow, pay close attention to their
        roots as some vegetables might require that they be placed in larger
        containers as they grow in order for their growth to not be stunted, and
        so that the vegetable might produce.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Be Consistent
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create a habit of watering your plant consistently at the same time,
        this helps the plant from staying out of survival mode, and will allow
        your plant to grow and produce. Enjoy watching your garden grow, and
        enjoy the blessing of having fresh, healthy, delicious vegetables right
        at your fingertips.

        Planting an Outdoor garden
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you want to just get a jump start on growing your garden, you can
        start your garden indoors. Even when it is cold outside you could be
        preparing for the time when you will be able to move your indoor garden
        outside. Rather than pay exorbitant prices in having others do the work
        for you, you could raise your own starter plants and save.
      </p>

      <h2>
        When do I Plant Outdoors?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Once you have your garden up and growing, and temperatures outside have
        risen to 50 degrees or higher at night and even higher during the day,
        once there is no risk of your plant becoming frost bitten, you can start
        to acclimate your plants. You can do this by taking your plants outside
        for 2 to 4 hours for a day or two, then gradually increasing the number
        of hours until you can leave them outside the entire time without fear
        of the plant being frostbitten or stunted. When this happens, it is time
        to plant your indoor garden outside.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Tips on Transferring My Garden
      </h2>
      <p>
        Every vegetable has different requirements to get the most yield. Read
        your seed packet to discover what are the requirements for your special
        brand of seeds. For the most part tomatoes should be planted deep into
        the dirt, covering the stems up to the first set of branches, and then
        watering them well to avoid the plant going into shock. Tomato plants
        typically should be planted 18 to 24 inches apart. Cucumbers, melons,
        pumpkins, squash, and zucchini grow best when you build the dirt up in
        the shape of a mound. Plant your vines at the top of the mound, and
        water well. Cucumbers should be planted 3 to 4 feet apart, pumpkins 6 to
        8 feet apart. Squash, zucchini and melons require a lot more space. They
        require as much as 18 to 30 feet apart dependent on the particular type
        of species. Only use fertilizers safe for use on vegetables. Pay
        attention to watering details on your seed packet to avoid over watering
        or burning your plant.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A Healthier Choice
      </h2>
      <p>
        With a bit of planning, you and your family could enjoy freshly grown
        vegetables right from your very own garden. This could help in teaching
        family members necessary self-reliance skills, improve their general
        health, and could be a great advocate of promoting healthy lifestyles.
